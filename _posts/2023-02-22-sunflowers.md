Sunflowers dressed in sundresses picnic in the park. They laugh, heads thrown back, mouths ready to swallow the summer sun. They glow with overture-heat, the kind that knows your body is at-best a fragile thing. They smell like the feeling of a baking beach meeting bare feet. With carnival sounds between their seeds, and growth that's paced like young lovers' temporary fling. Sunflowers belong in windblown hair and filling up the frames of ameture paintings.
