I see their silhouettes outlined against the orange of the desert summer sunset. Sweet sun bashful at her exposure, spending all day uncovered in a cloudless sky. I see them dancing not in-time to any music rather outside of time, beyond it somehow. Too ancient are they to move to a rhythm composed of human notes. So, completely submerged in stillness; they dance. Long arms extended in gentle curves from their bodies, a fouetté that takes eons to complete. I strain to hear their music, wishing for their dry and lonely patience. Instead my own emotions are always sopping, spilling up and over my eyes and chest. These creatures are disparate but I still see us in them. I see their trunks and their flowering heads, two bodies standing side by side along the road and I collapse into imagined stories of lovers, lost in the intoxication of the blooming desert sand. Do I do them an injustice by imagining they are like me? Failing to hear their song, am I sinful to sing to them? Is it unfair to picture beating hearts beneath their spiny skin? When I see their arms pushing skyward do I shame them by imagining their joy, by prescribing them my own sodden feelings? Is it wrong to ask the cactus, “beautiful, beloved, stranger might we be kin?”
